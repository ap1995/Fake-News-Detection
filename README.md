# Fake-News-Detection
Deep Learning for NLP HW2

This project attempts to classify fake news from the LIAR dataset. <br />
My first approach involves using LinearSVC classifier, a model using which gives an accuracy of 0.204 on the test data. <br />
My next approach was to use SGDClassifier, whose model gives an accuracy of 0.235 on the test data. <br />
The best published results on this dataset get an accuracy of 0.274 as their best, using CNNs.
