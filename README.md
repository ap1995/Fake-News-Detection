# Fake-News-Detection
Deep Learning for NLP HW2

This project attempts to classify fake news from the LIAR dataset. \\
My first approach involves using LinearSVC classifier, a model using which gives an accuracy of 0.204 on the test data.
My next apporach was to use SGDClassifier, whose model gives an accuracy of 0.235 on the test data.
The best published results on this dataset get an accuracy of 0.274 as their best, using CNNs.
